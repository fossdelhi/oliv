# Oliv

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fossdelhi/oliv.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fossdelhi/oliv)

What happens when your hard disk fries, or eventually you want to get a new machine? You tend up to loose all your dev configuration after years of hard work tweaking things here and there according to your liking.

Configuring a dev machine according to your liking would've been a really daunting task until and unless there were dotfiles.

Here comes `Oliv`! A command line utility to generate dotfile setup with a single command. Developers do not have to worry about their dotfiles setups in case they want to change their OS or suffer with system crash problems. What they have to do just install `Oliv`, generate dotfile setup and push that on your github profile for later use.


# Installation


Use the python package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).


```
pip install oliv
```

# Usage

To make the dotfile setup

```
$ oliv --make
```

**NOTE**
:- It is suggested to run oliv from your **_Home_** directory.

And to configure your system with dotfile setup generated by `Oliv`

```
$ oliv --setup
```
